The dark shadow in the back of the object are called core shadows. it is Default shadows.
What are we missing are the drop shadows.
Shadows: It is real time challenge for 3d rendering and developers must find tricks to display realistic shadows at a responsible frame rate.

1. When we do one render Three.js will do a render for each light supporting shadows.
2. Those renders will simulate what the light sees as if it was a camera.
3. During these lights render a meshdepthMaterial replaces all meshes material. 
4. the lights Render are stored as textures and we call those shadow maps.

we have a plane ,a object , an ambientlight and directional light.

Activate the shadow map on the render.
only following type of light support shadows
   . Pointlight
   . directionalight
   . Spotlight

Shadow map algorithm:-
   . THREE.BasicShadowMap - very performant but lousy quality
   . THREE.PCFShadowMap - less performant but smoother edges (default)
   . THREE.PCFSoftShadowMap - less performant but even softer edges
   . THREE.VSMShadowMap - Less performant more constraints can have unexpected results
Check renderer section for adding the algorithm

A good alternative to three js shadows is baked shadows. We integrate shadows in texture that we apply on materials.

const camera = new THREE.PrespectiveCamera( field of view , aspect ratio , near , far  )

field of view (fov) :- vertical vision angle , in degree 
aspect ratio :- the width of the render divided by the height of the render
near and far :- corresponding to how camera close and far can see. An object or part of the object closer than near or futher than far will not show up.


Orthographc camera is differ from the prospective camera by its lack of prespective object has the same size regardless of their distance to the camera.

We have different controls on the camera check it in the documentation with example. In this we use orbit controls .

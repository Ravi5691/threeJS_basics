there are 6 parameter in cube shape or some other shape i don't know now.
width : the size on the x -axis
height : the size on the y-axis
depth : the size on the z -axis

widthSegments : how many subdivision in the xaxis
heightSegments : how many subdivision in the y-axis
depthSegments : how many subdivisions in the z-axis

subdivision corresponding to how much traingles should compose a face 
1 = 2 traingles per face
2 = 8 traingles per face 

Before creating a geometry we need to understand how to store bufer geometry data
. We are going to use Float32Array
  . typed array
  . can only store floats
  . fixed length
  . easier to handle for the computer

some geometry have faces that share common vertices.
When creating  a buffergeometry we can specify a bunch of vertices and then the indices to create the faces and re-use vertices multiple times.

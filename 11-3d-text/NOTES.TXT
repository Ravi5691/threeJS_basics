creating a text geometry is long and hard for the computer.  Avois=d doing it too many times and keep the geometry as low poly possible by reducing the curveSegments and bevelSegments.
Remove the wireframe once happy with the level of details.

Center the text :- We have multiple way.
   . using the bounding : The bounding is an information associated with the geometry that tells what space is takenby that geometry.It can be a box or a sphere.
   It helps Three.js calculate if the object is on the screen (frustum culling) . We are going to use the bounding measures to recenter the geometry.
   The result is an instance of Box3 with min and max properties . The min property isn't at 0 because of the bevelThickness and bevelSize.
